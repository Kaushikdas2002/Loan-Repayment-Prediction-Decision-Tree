# Loan-Repayment-Prediction-Decision-Tree

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan repayment using a decision tree algorithm. Loan repayment prediction is a crucial aspect of risk assessment for financial institutions. This project aims to develop a predictive model to assist in determining the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan based on various features .  

## Introduction
The predictive model is built using a decision tree algorithm, which is a popular choice for binary classification tasks like loan repayment prediction. The decision tree considers various features and their interactions to classify loan applicants into two categories: likely to repay or unlikely to repay.

## Results
The model's performance on the test set is as follows:

Accuracy: 92.5%
Precision: 93%
Recall: 93%
F1 Score: 93%
